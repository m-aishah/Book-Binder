## Project Overview

### üìñ The Backstory

This whole thing started as a project for my COMP 337 DBMS course during the 2nd year Fall Semester at the European University of Lefke. The assignment was to create a simple CRUD app, but why stop there? I decided to go all out and make something extra cool.

### ‚ùì The Problem

As a book lover, I kept forgetting which books I had read. So, I built **Book Binder**, a slick app that helps readers keep track of their books and lets authors see how popular they are (or aren't).

### üéØ Goals

- **Readers**: Keep a digital bookshelf.
- **Authors**: See your reader count and average ratings.
- **Me**: Implement CRUD operations and have fun coding!

## Why Python? üêç

I chose Python because it's easy to work with, has tons of community support, and plays nicely with MySQL. Plus, at the time I wanted to learn to use tkinter, so what better way to learn than to create something with it.

## Database Stuff üíæ

### The Database

I went with MySQL for this project because it's robust and I had some prior experience with it. It turned out to be a great choice.

### Relationships

Here's how the database is structured:

- **Reader**: (ReaderID, Username, FirstName, LastName, PasswordHash, Email, Bio)
- **Author**: (AuthorID, Username, FirstName, LastName, PasswordHash, Email, About)
- **Book**: (BookID, Title, AuthorID, YearReleased, Genre, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)
- **ReaderBookshelf**: (BookID, ReaderID, Rating, DateInserted)

You can check out the SQL queries I used in the [MySQL Queries](./MySQL%20Queries/create_queries.sql).

## What It Can Do üõ†Ô∏è

- **Add Data**: Sign up as a reader or author, and add books to your shelf.
- **Delete Data**: Remove books from your shelf.
- **Update Data**: Change your ratings for books.
- **View Data**: See your bookshelf or author dashboard.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- MySQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/m-aishah/Book-Binder.git
    cd Book-Binder
    ```

2. Install the required Python modules:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the MySQL database:
    - Create a new database in MySQL.
    - Run the queries in the `database_queries.sql` file to create the necessary tables.

4. Update the database configuration in the code if necessary (e.g., username, password).

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python landing_page.py
    ```

## Screenshots üì∏

To get started, just run the `landing_page.py` module. Check out some screenshots:

## My Thoughts üí≠

Working on this project was a blast. It was challenging but incredibly rewarding. I learned a ton about GUI development and database interactions.

## Wrapping Up üéâ

**Book Binder** hit all the goals I set out for it. It provides a slick interface for readers and authors alike. Sure, there were some bumps along the way (like dependency hell), but I‚Äôm super proud of how it turned out.
